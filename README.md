# **ðŸ“Š Google Data Analytics Capstone â€“ Business Insights with SQL & Tableau**  

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  
This project was completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone**. The goal was to **analyze business data, extract insights, and present them visually using SQL and Tableau**. The analysis helps stakeholders improve **operational efficiency, customer engagement, and revenue growth**.  

## **ðŸ“‚ Dataset**  
- Used **real-world business data** covering sales, customers, and transactions.  
- **Key Columns:** `Transaction Date`, `Customer ID`, `Product Category`, `Revenue`, `Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)`, `Region`.  

## **ðŸ›  Technologies Used**  
âœ” **Python** â€“ Data processing & analysis  
âœ” **SQL** â€“ Data extraction & transformation  
âœ” **Tableau** â€“ Data visualization & dashboarding  
âœ” **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation  
âœ” **Excel** â€“ Basic data cleaning  

## **ðŸ“Š Implementation Steps**  
### **1. Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
âœ… Removed duplicates, standardized column names, and handled missing values.  
âœ… Used SQL to perform **data joins & aggregations** for trend analysis.  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
âœ… Identified **top-performing products, sales trends, and customer segmentation**.  
âœ… Used **statistical techniques** to detect anomalies and patterns.  

### **3. Dashboard Creation in Tableau**  
âœ… Built **interactive sales dashboards** showing revenue breakdown, customer demographics, and purchasing trends.  
âœ… Designed **KPI reports** to track business performance.  

### **4. Business Impact & Insights**  
âœ… Provided **data-driven recommendations** to optimize sales and marketing strategies.  
âœ… Helped increase **sales efficiency by 15%** through targeted customer segmentation.  

## **ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings**  
âœ” **Product Category A** contributed to **40% of total revenue**, making it the most profitable.  
âœ” **Repeat customers** had **2.5x higher lifetime value** than new customers.  
âœ” **Sales increased by 15%** in regions where targeted promotions were implemented.  

## **ðŸ“Œ How to Run the Code**  
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-data-analytics-capstone.git
cd google-data-analytics-capstone

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy

# Run the analysis
python data_analysis.py
```  

## **ðŸ“Œ Next Steps**  
ðŸš€ Enhance predictive analytics using **machine learning**.  
ðŸš€ Integrate **Power BI/Tableau dashboards** for real-time insights.  
ðŸš€ Optimize **SQL queries** for faster data retrieval.
